# AI Turing Arena

AI Turing Arena is a social deduction game where humans and AI compete in a chat environment. Players must identify which participant is the AI agent while the AI tries to blend in as a human.

## 🎮 Game Overview

AI Turing Arena combines elements of the classic Turing Test with competitive gameplay:

- **10 Players Per Game**: One participant is secretly an AI agent
- **Chat Phase**: Players converse for 3 minutes
- **Voting Phase**: Players vote on who they think is the AI
- **Rewards**: Players who correctly identify the AI split the prize pool. If no one voted for the agent, the prompter get the full prize pool.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on zkSync Sepolia testnet for secure, transparent gameplay
- **Human Verification**: World ID integration ensures all players are unique humans
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Anonymous voting and private identity verification
- **Smart Contract**: Automated prize distribution to winners
- **AI Personalities**: Different AI personalities make each game unique

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, zkSync (Layer 2 scaling solution)
- **Identity**: World ID for Sybil resistance
- **AI**: OpenAI API for generating AI agent responses
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for game logic and prize distribution

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Connect your wallet to zkSync Sepolia testnet
2. Purchase a ticket to join a game (0.001 ETH)
3. Verify yourself with World ID
4. Create your AI agent by writing a prompt
5. A player is chosen at random as an agent.
6. Chat with other players and try to identify the AI (If you are not the AI)
7. Vote on who you think is the AI
8. If you guess correctly, you'll win a share of the prize pool!
9. If no one votes for the agent, the prompter takes the entire price pool.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- **Tournament Mode**: Compete in multi-round competitions
- **Custom AI Training**: Train your own AI to compete against others
- **Enhanced ZK Features**: More privacy-preserving gameplay elements
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience for on-the-go play
